# ServiceNow Public Instance Info

First a HUGE shout out to Jace Benson for his ideas, knowledge and dedication to this extension. Please check out all the amazing work he is doing [on his website](jace.pro), [on his GitHub](https://github.com/jacebenson), or [on his Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacebenson)


This is a Google Chrome extension that can indicate whether or not you're currently interacting with a ServiceNow instance. 
To install the non-packed version:

 1. Download and extract the files to your local machine.
 2. Open Google Chrome and head over to the extensions page ([chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
 3. Click on "Load Unpacked" button and select the folder you downloaded in step 1. 
	 PLEASE NOTE: This puts your browser into Developer Mode and will ask you if that is OK every...single...time...you open the browser. A "production" ready extension will be available in the Chrome Web Store later.

## Justification
Sometimes, we want to know EXACTLY what the ServicePortal is capable of! The best way to get inspiration is to see what others are doing! Some ServicePortal work is SO beautiful, you might not even notice you're using it. This extension gives you visibility and allows you to understand what is capable in each release family of ServiceNow.

### Disclaimer
This extension is not developed, maintained or even associated with ServiceNow in any official capacity. Also, getting the correct instance family name is accessed with stats.do which is publicly available by default. A hardened instance will NOT return stats.do, as it shouldn't. Any change to the out of the box functionality by ServiceNow or the instance owner my alter this behavior.
